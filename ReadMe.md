# Prompt Engineering Guide

This guide was born out of curiosity whether ChatGPT itself can guide a user to create prompts that are effective from the ChatGPT point of view and  make sense for humans.
As ChatGPT sums it up: "This guide is your go-to resource for mastering the art of prompt engineering with ChatGPT. Whether you're a casual user aiming to boost productivity or a developer looking to seamlessly integrate GPT into workflows, this guide offers practical techniques and insights to get you there. You'll learn how to craft clear, effective prompts, troubleshoot common pitfalls, and explore advanced strategies to unlock GPT’s full potential—turning it into not just a tool, but a creative and reliable collaborator. Let’s transform “let’s see what happens” into “that’s exactly what I needed!”"
