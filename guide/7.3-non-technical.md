## 7.3. Non-Technical Use Cases

Prompt engineering isn't just for solving technical challenges---it's a
tool for everyone. From simplifying communication to organising your day
or creating educational materials, GPT can make everyday tasks easier
and more impactful. In fact, this very guide is a prime example of how
GPT can assist in creating educational resources. By using properly
engineered prompts with feedback, GPT and I collaborated to design
structured, accessible content that supports learning and exploration.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   GPT can assist with a variety of tasks, including writing, planning,
    learning, and organising.

-   Well-crafted prompts make communication clearer and more engaging.

-   GPT is a valuable partner for managing your day and simplifying
    complex concepts for teaching or learning.

### Under the Hood

**Key Points**

1.  **Simplify Complex Topics**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Breaking down complex information makes it
        accessible to a wider audience.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Ask GPT to summarise, rephrase, or
        explain in simpler terms.

    -   **Example**: \"Explain how the human circulatory system works in
        150 words for a 10-year-old.\"

2.  **Write Professional Emails**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Clear and concise communication is essential
        for professional success.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Use GPT to draft or refine your
        messages.

    -   **Example**: \"Draft a polite follow-up email to a colleague
        about a missed deadline.\"

3.  **Plan Events or Projects**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Structured planning ensures that everything
        runs smoothly.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Ask GPT to create checklists or suggest
        ideas.

    -   **Example**: \"Create a checklist for planning a weekend camping
        trip, including food, gear, and safety tips.\"

4.  **Organise Your Day**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Personal organisation improves productivity
        and reduces stress.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Use GPT to create schedules or
        prioritise tasks.

    -   **Example**: \"Plan my day with three hours for work, one hour
        for exercise, and time for family dinner.\"

5.  **Create Educational Resources**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Well-designed learning materials benefit
        both teachers and students. This guide itself was developed
        using GPT to draft, refine, and organise its sections,
        demonstrating how prompt engineering can be used to create
        comprehensive educational materials.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Ask GPT to develop lesson plans,
        quizzes, or study guides.

    -   **Example**: \"Create a multiple-choice quiz for middle school
        students on the water cycle.\"

6.  **Brainstorm Creative Ideas**

    -   **Why It Matters**: GPT can inspire new approaches to challenges
        or projects.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Use GPT to generate suggestions or
        explore alternatives.

    -   **Example**: \"Suggest five unique themes for a community talent
        show.\"

7.  **Summarise Lengthy Documents**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Summaries save time and help convey key
        points quickly.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Ask GPT to condense information into
        concise formats.

    -   **Example**: \"Summarise this 10-page report into five key
        points for a non-technical audience.\"

8.  **Develop Inclusive Content**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Engaging diverse audiences ensures your
        message resonates widely.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Use GPT to adapt tone, language, or
        examples.

    -   **Example**: \"Rewrite this announcement for a global audience,
        avoiding region-specific jargon.\"

**Advanced Examples**

1.  *Prompt*: \"Plan a study schedule for a college student preparing
    for final exams, balancing study time and breaks.\"

    -   **Why It Works**: Balances productivity and well-being with
        actionable advice.

2.  *Prompt*: \"Draft a short script for a video tutorial explaining how
    to recycle household waste.\"

    -   **Why It Works**: Provides clarity and structure for creating
        effective educational content.

3.  *Prompt*: \"Suggest five ways to make a personal budget more
    accessible and easy to follow for someone new to finance.\"

    -   **Why It Works**: Combines practical advice with an inclusive
        approach to personal organisation.

4.  *Prompt*: \"Collaboratively draft a structured educational guide on
    prompt engineering, focusing on practical examples and actionable
    strategies.\"

    -   **Why It Works**: This mirrors the process used to create this
        guide, demonstrating how GPT can help with educational resource
        development.

**Pro Tips**

1.  **Ask for Specific Outputs**: The clearer your goal, the better GPT
    can tailor its response. For example, specify the tone, audience, or
    length of the output.

2.  **Iterate for Improvement**: If the first result doesn't meet your
    needs, refine your prompt and try again. Iteration ensures quality
    results.

3.  **Adapt for Your Context**: Tailor prompts to your personal or
    professional needs to maximise relevance and usability.

4.  **Use with Caution for Complex Transcripts**: GhatGPT isn't
    particularly good when it comes to analysing transcripts with
    several participants discussing complex topics that touch multiple
    areas.

    -   Guide ChatGPT to the areas that you know are of importance.

    -   Paste relevant parts of the transcript and ask to refine content
        based on it

    -   Ask ChatGPT to review the generated outcome and suggest
        improvements (see 3.5. [Creating Prompts with Built-In Feedback](guide/3.5-feedback-prompts.md) ).

    -   Always, always do the final edit and correct all the
        inconsistencies before publishing the final version.
