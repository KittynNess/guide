## 3.6: Understanding and Mitigating GPT Shortcomings

No tool is perfect, and GPT is no exception. Understanding its
limitations empowers you to use it effectively, mitigate potential
pitfalls, and get the most out of its capabilities. By addressing these
shortcomings thoughtfully, you can adapt your prompts and workflows to
overcome them.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   GPT has limitations, and knowing what they are is crucial for
    creating effective prompts

-   GPT cannot generate accurate content without sufficient input.

-   It may hallucinate, overgeneralize, or misunderstand ambiguous
    instructions.

-   Adapt your approach to mitigate shortcomings like token limits,
    filtered topics, and lack of real-world reasoning.

-   Validate outputs and provide additional context to improve quality

### Under the Hood

**Common GPT Shortcomings: Impacts and Solutions**

1.  **Hallucinations:** GPT may provide outputs unsupported by facts
    (invent them).

-   **Impact:** Misleading or incorrect outputs can reduce reliability.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Validate outputs with external sources or domain experts.

    -   Use constraints like: \"If uncertain, state \'I don't know\' or
        ask for clarification.\"

    -   See Section [3.3. Minimizing
        Hallucinations](#minimizing-hallucinations)

2.  **Ambiguity and Overgeneralization**\
    Responses may lack actionable insights or fail to meet expectations.

-   **Impact:** Vague or irrelevant answers that do not address user
    needs.

-   **Solution:** Provide clear, specific prompts with explicit tasks.\
    **Example**: Instead of \"Explain AI,\" ask, \"Explain how neural
    networks are used in image recognition for a beginner audience.\"

3.  **Context Window Limitations:** Critical context may be lost in
    lengthy conversations.

-   **Impact:** Information from earlier prompts may be omitted or
    forgotten.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Reintroduce key context periodically.

    -   Summarize prior discussions to refresh GPT's understanding.

    -   Limit conversations to around 10--15 key prompts or
        approximately 3,000--4,000 tokens to reduce the risk of losing
        critical information.

    -   **Start new sessions for extended tasks:** Use a structured
        summary file to transfer critical context and continue
        seamlessly in a new session

4.  **Dependence on Training Data:** Responses might be outdated or lack
    domain-specific expertise. GPT's knowledge is limited to its
    training data

-   **Impact:** Information may not reflect the latest developments or
    nuanced knowledge.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Ask GPT to clarify the source or reliability of its knowledge.

    -   Specify the knowledge cutoff date in your prompts.

    -   Cross-check critical information with up-to-date, external
        sources.

5.  **Bias in Outputs:** Results might perpetuate stereotypes or exclude
    diverse perspectives as GPT may reflect biases present in its
    training data.

-   **Impact:** Imbalanced or non-inclusive outputs.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Frame prompts to encourage balanced perspectives

    -   Example: \"Explain both benefits and potential drawbacks of
        automation in manufacturing.\"

6.  **Restricted or Filtered Topics:** GPT avoids certain topics,
    entities, or names due to built-in moderation.

-   **Impact:** Responses may exclude critical details or become vague
    when addressing sensitive subjects.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Reframe the query to focus on permissible aspects of the topic.\
        **Example**: \"Provide a neutral overview of controversies
        surrounding AI ethics without sensationalism.\"

    -   Seek external sources for highly sensitive or restricted
        information.

7.  **Data Cutoff and Inability to Access the Internet:** GPT-3.5 is
    limited to data up to September 2021, while GPT-4's cutoff is April
    2024.

-   **Impact:** Responses may provide outdated information or fail to
    address recent developments.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Combine GPT with external tools for real-time data where
        possible

    -   Manually fact-check GPT responses for accuracy using up-to-date
        sources like search engines or trusted domain experts.

    -   Incorporate current data manually when crafting prompts.

8.  **Incomplete Responses**\
    GPT may truncate answers, particularly in lengthy or complex
    prompts.

-   **Impact:** Key details may be omitted, resulting in partial
    answers.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Divide lengthy requests into modular tasks.

    -   Use sequential prompts to build comprehensive answers.

9.  **Often Responds in List Forms:** Without guidance, GPT tends to
    generate responses in a list format, which may not suit every need.

-   **Impact:** Lists may lack depth or nuance, especially in narrative
    content.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Specify the desired output format in prompts, e.g. \"Provide a
        detailed narrative rather than a list format.\"

10. **Common Sense Issues:** GPT struggles with nuanced human reasoning,
    logic, or common-sense scenarios.

-   **Impact:** Responses may sound linguistically correct but lack
    logical coherence.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Include clear and detailed prompts to reduce ambiguity.

    -   Provide explicit context or clarifications for real-world
        reasoning, e.g. \"Explain the decision-making process behind
        this scenario as if you were reasoning it out with common sense.

    -   Validate outputs for logical consistency

11. **Session Data Loss:** GPT can lose both older context (pushed out
    by token limits) and the most recent parts of a conversation (due to
    glitches or session resets).

-   **Impact:**

    -   Older context loss leads to repeated efforts and disrupts
        continuity.

    -   Recent data loss interrupts ongoing discussions and requires
        recreation of recent outputs.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Regularly save key outputs and progress externally.

    -   Create periodic summaries for quick reference to serve as quick
        reference points (e.g., \"So far, we've discussed \[Key
        Points\]. Here's what we're focusing on next: \[Next Steps\].\")

    -   Use checkpoint summaries at the end of major topics that can be
        reintroduced if needed.

    -   Plan for continuity by keeping manual notes combined with
        automated session backups, where possible

    -   For large projects, divide work into smaller, focused sessions
        with clear starting and ending summaries to minimize the impact
        of data loss.

12. **Limited Context Understanding:** GPT may misinterpret nuanced
    questions or fail to handle complex topics effectively

-   **Impact:** Responses may lack depth or miss critical details.

<!-- -->

-   **Solution:**

    -   Use precise and explicit language in prompts.

    -   Experiment with different strategies to refine results

12. **Multilingual Limitations:** GPT's quality depends on the language
    and its training data.

-   **Impact:** Responses in less commonly spoken languages may lack
    fluency or depth.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Avoid mixing languages within the same prompt or switching
        languages mid-session.

    -   When accuracy matters, consult native speakers or specialized
        resources.

    -   Provide clear prompts in the target language to improve
        comprehension

13. **Poor Comprehension of Niche Topics:** GPT excels in general
    knowledge but may falter with highly specialized subjects.

-   **Impact:** Superficial or off-target responses to niche topics.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Supplement GPT's responses with external, specialized sources.

    -   Add detailed context to enhance comprehension.

14. **Privacy and Security Risks:** GPT may inadvertently expose
    sensitive information.

-   **Impact:** Sharing personal or confidential data in prompts can
    lead to privacy breaches.

-   **Solution:**

    -   Avoid including sensitive data in prompts.

    -   Use GPT strictly for non-confidential tasks.

### Closing Thoughts

When you know abilities and limitations of anything, you can use it
efficiently. Acknowledging GPT's limitations is not just a
precaution---it's an opportunity to refine your prompt engineering
approach. By understanding common shortcomings, providing clear and
thoughtful instructions, and validating outputs, you can maximize GPT's
potential while minimizing risks. Do not blindly trust ChatGPT or any
other AI, use critical thinking and always check, check, check, and then
check again.
