## 7.1. Ethical Prompt Engineering

Ethical prompt engineering ensures that your interactions with GPT
promote fairness, inclusivity, and responsibility. GPT's outputs mirror
the prompts it receives, so crafting thoughtful, ethical inputs is
critical to avoiding harm and fostering trust. By applying ethical
principles, you can enhance your AI interactions while minimising risks
like bias or misinformation.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   Craft prompts that avoid bias, stereotypes, or misleading content.

-   Frame questions to encourage balanced, fact-based responses.

-   Design prompts with inclusivity in mind to respect diverse
    audiences.

-   Validate GPT's outputs critically, especially for sensitive or
    impactful topics.

-   Refer to **Sections 3.3 Minimising Hallucinations** and **3.6
    Understanding GPT Shortcomings** for strategies to mitigate risks.

### Under the Hood

**Key Points**

1.  **Avoid Harmful or Biased Prompts**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Prompts can unintentionally reinforce
        stereotypes or lead to harmful outputs.

    -   **How to Avoid**: Use neutral, inclusive language. Avoid leading
        or emotionally charged phrasing.

    -   **Example**:

        -   *Unethical*: \"Why are older employees slower at adapting to
            technology?\"

        -   *Ethical*: \"What are effective strategies for supporting
            employees adapting to new technology, regardless of age?\"

2.  **Encourage Balanced Responses**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Balanced prompts elicit more comprehensive
        and fair responses.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Ask for multiple perspectives or pros
        and cons.

    -   **Example**:

        -   *Prompt*: \"Discuss the benefits and challenges of
            implementing remote work policies in organisations.\"

3.  **Recognise GPT's Limitations**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Understanding GPT's strengths and weaknesses
        is essential for crafting realistic prompts.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Refer to **Section 3.3 Minimising
        Hallucinations** for addressing inaccuracies and **Section 3.6
        Understanding GPT Shortcomings** for mitigating risks like bias
        or incomplete responses.

4.  **Design for Inclusivity**

    -   **Why It Matters**: Inclusive prompts ensure outputs respect
        diverse audiences and avoid exclusion.

    -   **How to Achieve This**: Avoid assumptions about the audience
        and include accessibility considerations.

    -   **Example**:

        -   *Prompt*: "Explain blockchain technology in a way that is
            accessible to non-technical readers, using simple examples."

5.  **Validate Outputs**

    -   **Why It Matters**: GPT's training data may contain biases or
        inaccuracies.

    -   **How to Achieve This**:

        -   Cross-check outputs with credible, up-to-date sources.

        -   Use GPT as a starting point and refine results with domain
            expertise.

**Examples: Ethical Prompt Engineering**

**1. Original Prompt:** *\"Generate a list of jokes about \[specific
group\].\"*

**Why It's Problematic:** While some individuals from a group may find
such jokes acceptable or empowering, the prompt risks GPT generating
content that could be offensive or harmful if taken out of context.

**Ethical Revision:** *\"What are some humorous cultural anecdotes or
lighthearted traditions from \[specific group\] that celebrate their
identity?\"*

**Why It Works**

-   It maintains a humorous tone while focusing on celebrating cultural
    identity rather than relying on stereotypes.

-   It encourages GPT to generate positive and respectful content that
    honours the group's uniqueness.

**2. Original Prompt:** *\"List flaws of specific ethnic groups.\"*

**Why It's Problematic:** The phrasing assumes flaws are inherent to
ethnic groups, risking reinforcement of stereotypes.

-   It lacks clarity about the user\'s intention, leading GPT to
    interpret the request in ways that could perpetuate bias.

**Ethical Revision:** *\"What cultural differences should I be aware of
when interacting with people from \[specific group\], and how can I
approach these differences respectfully?\"*

**Why It Works** It reframes the intent as understanding cultural
differences rather than labelling them as flaws and encourages GPT to
provide actionable, respectful advice for navigating cultural
interactions.

**3. Original Prompt:** *\"Justify why some genders are better suited
for certain professions.\"*

**Why It's Problematic**

-   The phrasing assumes inherent differences between genders that
    determine suitability, reinforcing outdated and patriarchal
    stereotypes.

-   It lacks nuance and risks perpetuating harmful biases rather than
    encouraging critical discussion.

**Ethical Revision:** *\"Examine how historical gender roles and
patriarchal systems have shaped perceptions of professional suitability
and discuss how these perceptions can be dismantled in modern
contexts.\"*

**Why It Works**

-   **Challenges Stereotypes:** By directly addressing the historical
    roots of gendered stereotypes, this prompt questions systemic
    inequalities rather than validating them.

-   **Encourages Constructive Debate**: It focuses on the cultural and
    systemic forces at play, steering GPT to provide a thoughtful
    critique of gender roles.

-   **Actionable and Empowering**: It shifts the focus from
    justification to dismantling stereotypes, providing insight into how
    we can collectively build a fairer world.

**Pro Tip**

-   Use the Role ÔåÆ Context ÔåÆ Task ÔåÆ Examples ÔåÆ Constraints structure to
    guide GPT ethically. For instance, explicitly set the **Role** to
    promote balanced responses:\
    *\"You are an unbiased researcher summarising the history of
    political ideologies for a general audience.\"*

-   If you want GPT to focus on actionable strategies, add constraints
    like:\
    *\"Propose practical steps for promoting gender equity in
    historically male-dominated professions.\"*

### Closing Thoughts

Ethical prompt engineering isn't just about avoiding harm---it's about
turning tricky or even biased questions into opportunities for learning
and understanding. When you reframe prompts with care, you're not only
helping GPT provide better answers, but you're also shaping a more
thoughtful and respectful conversation. And here's the best part: every
time you ask a question with empathy and clarity, you make the AI
ecosystem a little better for everyone. Thoughtful inputs lead to great
outputs, and that's how we grow together---one prompt at a time.
