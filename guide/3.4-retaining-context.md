## 3.4. Retaining Context Across Multiple Prompts

When working on complex topics, retaining context across multiple
prompts ensures continuity and builds upon earlier discussions
effectively. This approach saves time, improves clarity, and avoids
redundancy, making each prompt more meaningful.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   Establish solid foundation for all prompts in the session in the
    beginning

-   Restate critical context periodically to refresh GPT's memory.

-   Use tags, summaries, or structured files to track ongoing
    discussions.

-   Modularize prompts into logical segments for clarity.

-   Use a summary file for sessions requiring sustained focus over
    multiple prompts.

-   Consider tools like Canvas for managing larger, long-term projects
    effectively.

### Under the hood

**Why Retaining Context Matters**

1.  **GPT's Context Window:** GPT remembers only a limited number of
    tokens within a session. Information outside this window may be
    forgotten.

2.  **Ambiguity from Missing Context:** If critical details are not
    reiterated, GPT may misinterpret or generalize responses.

3.  **Session Dependency:** Between sessions, GPT resets context
    entirely, requiring users to re-establish continuity manually.

**Strategies for Retaining Context**

1.  **Create and Use a Summary File:**

    -   Create a summary file at the end of each session that captures:

        -   Assigned roles.

        -   Agreed structure or tasks.

        -   Key points or decisions from the session.

        -   Examples or references critical for continuity.

Example Summary File Entry:

> Role: Expert in ML, AI, and prompt engineering.
>
> Key Context: Creating a user guide for effective prompt engineering,
> following the Pyramid Principle.
>
> Examples: Refer to Section 3.1 on prompt building blocks and why order
> matters.
>
> Tasks: Complete Section 3.4 focusing on multi-day session strategies.

-   Use this summary file to refresh GPT context every 5--10 prompts.

-   Copy only the relevant parts into prompts as needed.

-   Avoid pasting the entire session; focus on the critical snippets.

2.  **Plan Refeeding Frequency:**

    -   Refeed context approximately every **5--10 prompts** within the
        same session.

    -   For multi-day sessions, **reintroduce key information at the
        start of each session** or whenever transitioning to a new task.

    -   Avoid overloading prompts by focusing on the **most relevant
        details** for the current task.

3.  **Use Persistent Tags or Labels:**

    -   Assign tags to different parts of the conversation for easy
        reference.\
        Example: *\"\[Topic: Machine Learning Basics\]\"* or
        *\"\[Feedback: Examples of retaining context\]\"*.

4.  **Leverage Modular Prompts:**

    -   Divide tasks into smaller, logically connected subtasks to
        maintain focus.

    -   Example:

        -   Prompt 1: *\"Draft the introduction for \'Retaining Context
            Across Multiple Prompts.\' \"*

        -   Prompt 2: *\"Expand on strategies for modularizing
            prompts.\"*

5.  **Incorporate References to Previous Outputs:**

    -   Explicitly refer to prior work to ensure continuity.

    -   Example: *\"Building on the summary provided in Prompt X, refine
        the section by adding examples of modularizing tasks.\"*

6.  **File Management for Refeeding:**

    -   Maintain a central document or Canvas containing:

        -   Summary files for each session.

        -   Examples of writing style and refined sections.

        -   References to earlier discussions or decisions.

7.  **Copy Only Relevant Parts for Refeeding:**

    -   Instead of overloading GPT with entire conversations, extract
        and refeed only the essential snippets.

    -   Example: *\"Use the following context to refine the guide:
        \[Insert refined section snippet here.\]\"*

8.  **Integrate Tools like Canvas for Larger Projects:**

    -   For projects involving multiple iterations or extensive content,
        consider transitioning to Canvas, a workspace designed to
        streamline long-term and complex projects by maintaining
        continuity and enhancing collaboration. It allows you to
        organise, refine, and track your work with tools like inline
        feedback, targeted editing, and version history.

    -   Canvas session is a session within your current ChatGPT
        interaction when the document or code you are working on is open
        in the Canvas interface. It acts as a persistent session,
        keeping context for this particular document across multiple
        iterations. Once you close the Canvas, interactions revert to a
        regular session, where context is limited to a single
        interaction.

9.  **Switch between Canvas and Regular Sessions:**

    -   Switching between Canvas and regular sessions strategically can
        boost efficiency. Use Canvas for refining complex projects with
        persistent context, and regular sessions for quick brainstorming
        or tackling smaller tasks.

    -   Pro Tip: when switching between Canvas and regular sessions
        clearly specify:

        -   switching to a regular session mention that you are not
            working with the Canvas

        -   switching back to the Canvas document or between multiple
            Canvas documents, specify what exact Canvas document you
            want to work on

        -   manage creating a new Canvas document, going back to the
            regular session or working on a particular Canvas document
            with tags (e.g., \<new canvas\>. \<reg. session\>, \<current
            canvas\>).

        -   DO NOT FORGET to add these tags to the Constraints!

**Tagging Examples for Iterative Work**

1.  **Tagging Feedback:**

    -   When providing feedback on iterations, use consistent tags to
        highlight areas for improvement.

> Example: *\"\[Feedback: Examples Block\] The examples you provided in
> the last response were helpful but lacked clarity for beginners. Could
> you refine them?\"*

2.  **Tagging Questions:**

    -   Use tags to specify the focus of each question during iterative
        discussions.

> Example: *\"\[Question: Constraints Block\] Can you clarify how to
> phrase constraints for tasks involving technical writing?\"*

3.  **Combining Tags for Efficiency:**

    -   Combine tags to streamline iterations and connect related
        feedback and questions.

> Example: *\"\[Feedback: Role Definition\] The role description is
> clear, but it might be too formal for a casual audience. \[Question:
> Tone Adjustments\] How can I simplify the tone without losing
> credibility?\"*

**Effective Practices for Multi-Day Sessions**

**Example 1: Starting a New Session**\
Prompt: *\"Continuing from yesterday's discussion, let's refine Section
3.4 on managing multi-day sessions. Yesterday's decisions included:
\[recap points\]. Let's proceed with \[specific task\].\"*

**Why It Works:**

-   Provides a clear link to prior discussions.

-   Establishes alignment for the task at hand.

**Example 2: Using Summary Files**\
Prompt: *\"Here's the context from our previous sessions: \[insert
summary snippet\]. Use this to guide the next steps in refining Section
3.4.\"*

**Why It Works:1**

-   Refreshes critical context efficiently without overloading the
    prompt.

**Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

1.  **Overloading Prompts with Context:** Avoid pasting the entire
    session or excessive details. Instead, focus on key points and
    decisions.

2.  **Skipping Summaries Between Days:** Without reintroducing critical
    information, responses may lack continuity or relevance.

3.  **Inconsistent Refeeding:** Failing to reintroduce context after
    every 5--10 prompts or between sessions increases the chance of
    misalignment.

4.  **Lack of Modularization:** Tackling large tasks without breaking
    them into smaller, trackable steps can lead to fragmented outcomes.

### Closing Thoughts

Retaining context across prompts is both an art and a science. By using
tags, modular prompts, summary files, and refeeding periodically, you
can make your collaboration with GPT more cohesive and productive even
if your work includes many prompts and spans over several days. For
projects requiring extended collaboration or more complex workflows,
transitioning to Canvas simplifies context management and collaboration
between the user and ChatGPT.
