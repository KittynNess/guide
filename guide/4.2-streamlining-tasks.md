## 4.2. Streamlining Routine QE Tasks with AI

Routine tasks in Quality Engineering (QE), such as test data
preparation, bug report drafting, and documentation, often consume
valuable time and effort. AI tools like ChatGPT can help streamline
these repetitive activities, enabling Quality Engineers to focus on more
creative and strategic tasks like exploratory testing and quality
initiatives. By integrating AI effectively into these workflows, QE
teams can enhance their productivity, consistency, and overall impact.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   AI simplifies repetitive QE tasks, including generating test data
    and drafting bug reports.

-   Well-structured prompts ensure outputs are relevant, accurate, and
    consistent.

-   Iterative refinement of AI-generated outputs ensures alignment with
    project goals.

-   AI frees engineers to focus on higher-value tasks like
    problem-solving and strategic initiatives.

### Under the Hood

**Key Application Areas:**

1.  **Automating Test Data Creation:**\
    AI can generate realistic and diverse datasets tailored to specific
    testing needs, saving time and improving test coverage.

2.  **Simplifying Bug Report Drafting:**\
    Structured prompts allow AI to produce initial bug reports,
    including details like steps to reproduce and expected versus actual
    outcomes.

3.  **Standardising Documentation:**\
    AI-generated templates provide consistency in test plans, compliance
    reports, and release notes, reducing manual effort.

4.  **Enhancing Log Analysis:**\
    AI processes large datasets to summarise logs, identify critical
    issues, and propose potential solutions.

5.  **Iterative Refinement:**\
    AI-generated drafts serve as a starting point, allowing engineers to
    adjust and tailor outputs to fit specific requirements.

6.  **Risk-Based Test Prioritisation**\
    AI can analyse code changes, feature complexity, and historical
    defect data to prioritise high-risk areas for focused testing.

7.  **Smart Test Coverage Analysis**\
    By evaluating existing test cases and requirements, AI identifies
    coverage gaps, ensuring critical areas are tested efficiently.

8.  **AI-Assisted Regression Testing**\
    AI automates the selection of regression tests based on the scope of
    recent changes, reducing execution time while maintaining
    confidence.

9.  **Performance Trend Analysis**\
    AI can process performance metrics and highlight trends,
    bottlenecks, or regressions, enabling teams to optimise systems as
    they scale.

**Effective Prompt Examples**

Setting the **Role ÔåÆ Context ÔåÆ Task ÔåÆ Examples ÔåÆ Constraints** structure
ensures clarity and precision in AI outputs. Additionally, iterative
refinement within the same context allows AI to adapt outputs based on
previous interactions.

1.  **Test Data Creation**:

    -   *Role*: You are a test data generator.

    -   *Context*: We are testing an e-commerce platform with a wide
        range of users.

    -   *Task*: Generate a dataset of 50 unique customer profiles with
        realistic details like names, locations, purchase history, and
        preferences.

    -   *Examples*: Include customers who prefer electronics, books, or
        clothing and have made purchases within the last six months.

    -   *Constraints*: Ensure no duplicate emails and all data follows
        GDPR compliance.

**Iterative Approach**: Ask AI to refine the dataset by adding specific
purchase patterns or adjusting attributes for targeted scenarios.

2.  **Bug Report Drafting**:

    -   *Role*: You are a bug report assistant.

    -   *Context*: A login form is rejecting valid email addresses on an
        e-commerce website.

    -   *Task*: Draft a detailed bug report that includes expected
        behaviour, actual behaviour, and steps to reproduce.

    -   *Examples*: Include a sample email input such as
        "<user@example.com>" and specify the browser used during
        testing.

    -   *Constraints*: Keep the report concise and use headings like
        \"Summary,\" \"Steps to Reproduce,\" and \"Environment
        Details.\"

**Iterative Approach**: Request refinements to add missing details, such
as screenshots or specific error messages.

3.  **Standardising Documentation**:

    -   *Role*: You are a documentation generator.

    -   *Context*: The team is preparing for a new release of an online
        booking system.

    -   *Task*: Create a reusable template for release notes, including
        sections for features, fixes, and known issues.

    -   *Examples*: Add placeholders for version numbers, feature
        descriptions, and hyperlinks to detailed documents.

    -   *Constraints*: Ensure the document is no longer than two pages.

**Iterative Approach**: Update the template after team feedback to
include additional sections or change formatting.

4.  **Log Analysis for Reporting**:

    -   *Role*: You are a log analysis assistant.

    -   *Context*: Server logs show periodic 500 errors during high
        traffic.

    -   *Task*: Summarise key error patterns and provide possible
        causes.

    -   *Examples*: Highlight timestamps, affected endpoints, and error
        frequency.

    -   *Constraints*: Deliver the summary in bullet points for quick
        review.

**Iterative Approach**: Refine the analysis by asking for additional
insights, such as error distribution by hour or severity.

**Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

1.  **Ambiguous Prompts**:

    -   *Issue*: Lack of specificity results in generic or incomplete
        outputs.

    -   *Solution*: Use clear and structured prompts, defining the task,
        constraints, and context explicitly.

2.  **Assuming Outputs Are Perfect**:

    -   *Issue*: AI-generated results may contain inaccuracies or miss
        critical details.

    -   *Solution*: Always validate outputs and refine them based on
        domain knowledge.

3.  **Ignoring Iterative Refinement**:

    -   *Issue*: Static prompts may miss evolving project requirements.

    -   *Solution*: Use iterative interactions to refine outputs within
        the same context for better results.

4.  **Overreliance on AI**:

    -   *Issue*: Relying solely on AI without review can compromise
        quality.

    -   *Solution*: Treat AI as an assistant while retaining human
        oversight for critical tasks.

### Closing Thoughts

AI tools like ChatGPT can transform routine QE tasks, enabling teams to
work faster and more effectively. By structuring prompts with clarity
and leveraging iterative refinement, Quality Engineers can ensure
consistent, high-quality outputs. When repetitive activities are
streamlined, engineers can dedicate their expertise to delivering
innovation and building better software.
