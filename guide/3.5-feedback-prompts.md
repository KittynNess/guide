## 3.5. Creating Prompts with Built-In Feedback

Adding feedback tasks to your prompts not only improves the quality of
GPT's responses but also helps refine your prompt engineering skills. By
embedding evaluation and iterative improvement into your prompts, you
enable GPT to act as both a problem-solver and a collaborator. Giving
GPT \"time to think\"---by instructing it to review, reason, or
self-correct---enhances its ability to generate thoughtful and accurate
outputs, making it an even more effective partner in your tasks.

**Key Takeaways (TL;DR):**

-   Include feedback tasks alongside the main question to encourage
    self-assessment.

-   Ask GPT to reason through steps or explain its thought process for
    better accuracy.

-   Use modular prompts with clear sections for solutions, analysis, and
    self-reflection.

-   Provide explicit constraints and encourage iterative refinement to
    guide feedback generation.

-   Prompt GPT to self-check and validate its own outputs to improve
    quality and reliability.

### Under the Hood

**Why Create Prompts with Built-In Feedback?**

1.  **Iterative Learning:** Feedback loops transform interactions into
    an iterative learning process.

2.  **Enhanced Prompt Clarity:** GPT evaluates and improves prompts,
    leading to more effective instructions.

3.  **Continuous Refinement:** Built-in feedback fosters an evolving
    approach to prompt engineering, adapting to various tasks.

4.  **Clarity in Communication:** Prompts with feedback help highlight
    misunderstandings and adjust outputs accordingly.

5.  **Encouraging Thoughtful Responses:** Giving GPT tasks like
    reviewing its output or identifying overlooked details fosters
    deeper reasoning. *Example:* \"Here's your response. What key points
    might I have missed, and how can they be added?\"

6.  **Simulating Problem-Solving:** Asking GPT to simulate a \"thought
    process\" helps clarify steps in solving complex tasks. *Example:*
    \"Generate a solution, then explain the reasoning behind each step
    as if teaching a beginner.\"

**Strategies for Building Feedback into Prompts**

1.  **Encourage a Step-by-Step Approach:** Break tasks into smaller
    steps and instruct GPT to summarise progress after each.\
    *Example:* \"Plan a two-day conference itinerary. Start with the
    first day, and once completed, summarise before moving to the
    next.\"

2.  **Include Evaluation Tasks:** Add a specific task for GPT to assess
    its own response.\
    *Example:* \"Explain how transformers process sequential data. Then
    evaluate this response for clarity and accuracy, suggesting any
    improvements.\"

3.  **Critique and Improve Prompts:** Request feedback on the prompt's
    structure, clarity, and effectiveness.\
    *Example:* \"Answer the question, and evaluate this prompt by
    identifying strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for
    improvement.\"

4.  **Incorporate Improvement Suggestions:** Direct GPT to suggest
    alternative phrasing or approaches.\
    *Example:* \"Rewrite this paragraph for a beginner audience. Then
    suggest two ways to make it clearer.\"

5.  **Leverage Modular Components:** Structure prompts with labelled
    sections for solutions and feedback.\
    *Example:* Task Solution: \[Answer to the main task\] Prompt
    Analysis: \[Strengths, weaknesses, and improvements\]

6.  **Ask GPT to Review Its Logic:** Direct GPT to identify gaps or
    inconsistencies in its reasoning.\
    *Example:* \"Draft a marketing plan. Then review your own proposal
    for logical consistency and potential gaps.\"

7.  **Define Success Criteria:** Specify what GPT should focus on during
    feedback (e.g., clarity, tone, or structure).\
    *Example:* \"Evaluate whether this prompt uses concise language and
    clear structure.\"

8.  **Prompt for Error Detection:** Include directives for GPT to find
    and correct mistakes in its own output.\
    *Example:* \"Generate a list of pros and cons for remote work. Then
    identify and correct any logical inconsistencies in your response.\"

9.  **Recurring Feedback Tasks:** Use consistent feedback guidelines
    across multiple prompts to maintain focus and avoid redundancy.\
    *Example:* \"Analyse the response for logical consistency and revise
    the prompt as per previous feedback criteria.\"

**Effective Prompt Examples**

**Example 1:**\
\*\"Explain how self-attention in transformers works. Then evaluate this
prompt:

-   Identify its strengths and weaknesses.

-   Suggest specific improvements.

-   Provide a revised version with explanations for the changes.\"\*

**Why It Works:**

-   Combines problem-solving with prompt refinement.

-   Encourages GPT to think critically about its own inputs and outputs.

**Example 2:**\
*\"Summarise the main idea of this article. Then evaluate your summary:
Did you include all key points? If not, revise it to include any missing
details.\"*\
**Why It Works:**

-   Encourages GPT to self-assess and refine its response.

-   Creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

**Example 3:**\
*\"Generate a beginner-friendly explanation of neural networks.
Afterward, critique this response for tone and accessibility, and
suggest ways to make it more engaging.\"*\
**Why It Works:** Links the main task with specific feedback, improving
the outcome in real time.

**Example 4:**\
*\"Design a user-friendly login page. After drafting, explain the design
choices and suggest two improvements for accessibility.\"*\
**Why It Works:** Encourages GPT to reflect on its output, promoting
thoughtful refinement.

**Example 5:**\
*\"Summarise this article in 200 words. Then evaluate whether your
summary includes all the critical points and adjust if necessary.\"*\
**Why It Works:** Creates a feedback loop, improving the accuracy of the
summary.

### Closing Thoughts

Prompts with built-in feedback elevate your interactions with GPT,
transforming it into both a collaborator and a tutor. Encouraging GPT to
reflect on its responses and reasoning strengthens its ability to
provide thoughtful, reliable, and actionable outputs. By giving GPT
\"time to think,\" you're not just generating answers---you're fostering
a process of iterative learning and refinement. Start small, experiment
with feedback loops, and see how this approach enhances your results
while making GPT an even more effective partner.
